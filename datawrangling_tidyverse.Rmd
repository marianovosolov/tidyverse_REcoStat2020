# Tibbles

>Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: **they do less** (i.e. they don't change variable names or types, and don't do partial matching) and **complain more** (e.g. when a variable does not exist). This forces you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code.

# Lets start practicing 
---

# Load the Star Wars data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data(starwars)
starwars
```
---
# Select the name, height, mass, and species columns only

--
```{r}
starwars %>% 
    select(name, height, mass, species)
```

---

# Add a bmi column (`mass/(0.01*height)^2`)

--
```{r}
starwars %>% 
    select(name, height, mass, species) %>% 
    mutate(bmi = mass/(0.01*height)^2)
```

---

# Sort the data based on the bmi
--
```{r}
starwars %>% 
    select(name, height, mass, species) %>% 
    mutate(bmi = mass/(0.01*height)^2) %>% 
    arrange(desc(bmi))
```

---

# Filter the data to have only Droids (found in species column)

--
```{r}
starwars %>% 
    select(name, height, mass, species) %>% 
    mutate(bmi = mass/(0.01*height)^2) %>% 
    filter(species == "Droid")
```

---

# Filter the same data to have only Droids shorter than 100 cm

--
```{r}
starwars %>% 
    select(name, height, mass, species) %>% 
    mutate(bmi = mass/(0.01*height)^2) %>% 
    filter(species == "Droid", height < 100)
```

---

## Create a summary data in which you have the avarage mass, maximum hight, and the number of individuals from each species, and sort it by the number of individuals
--

```{r}
starwars %>% 
    select(name, height, mass, species) %>% 
    group_by(species) %>% 
    summarize(count = n(),
              avg_mass = mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE),
              max_height = max(height, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
    arrange(desc(count))
```

# Your turn
---

- What is the most common eye color?

- Who is the youngest human?

- Which homeworld has the most characters?

---
# Rename columns with `rename()`
```{r}
starwars %>% 
    select(name, height, mass, species) %>% 
    rename(char_name = name)
```
---
# `rename_all()`

Change all the column names to upper case
```{r}
starwars %>% 
    select(name, height, mass, species) %>% 
    rename_all(toupper)
```

---
# `left_join()`

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  mutate(height_m = height*0.01) %>% 
  select(name,height_m) %>% 
  left_join(starwars,by = "name")
```

# What else can you do?

### spread == pivot_wider

---

# Community matrix!

```{r}
sw <- starwars %>% 
  select(name, films) %>% 
  unnest(films) %>% 
  mutate(present = 1) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = name,values_from = present,values_fill = list(present = 0)) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%

# `readr` package

<img src="img/readr.png" width=30%>

---

# read_xxx function

* Neater import than `read.table` and `read.csv`

* Does data check and prints a report of the data imported

* Character columns are not converted to factors

* Most useful are `read_csv`, `read_table`, and `read_delim`

* Competible with pipe workflow

---
# Example

```{r}
mydata<- read_csv("data/sub_PanTHERIA.csv")
```

---

```{r}
mydata
```

class: center, middle

# `janitor` package

<img src="img/janitor.png" width=40%>
---
# `clean_names()` function

* cleans the column names to something more computer friendly

* For example, brings all the column names to lowercase and adds underscores between words
---

# Regular column names
```{r}
mydata
```

---
# Clean column names

```{r}
mydata %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

---
# `nest` datasets

Useful when you want to run analyses group based but run it only ones

```{r}
nested_sw<- starwars %>% 
  select(name,height,films,mass, species,gender) %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  print()

```

---
# To see the first sub data

```{r}
nested_sw$data[1]
```

---
class: center, middle

# `purrr` package

<img src="img/purrr.png" width=30%>

---

# `map` function

* transform the input by applying a function to each element. (similar to `apply` function)

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  split(.$gender) %>% 
  map(~ summary(lm(height~mass,data = .)))
```

---
# Combin `nest()` with `map()`

```{r}
lm_nest<- starwars %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(lm_results = map(data,~ summary(lm(height~mass,data =.)))) %>% 
  print()

```

---

lm_nest$lm_results[1]
```

---
class: center, middle

# `broom` package

<img src="img/broom.png" width=30%>

# `tidy()` function

Allows you to print and save model results in a tabular view

```{r}
broom::tidy(lm_nest$lm_results[[1]])
```

---

.center[
# Other function that are compatible with ` %>% `
]


---

## `ggplot2` 

* can be piped into the sequence
```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
starwars %>% 
  select(height,mass,species) %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(log10(mass),log10(height),color = species))+
  geom_point()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

---
### omit all rows that contain `NA` somewhere in the data

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  na.omit()
```

---
# Run models on subset of the data

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  filter(species =="Droid") %>% 
  lm(height~mass,data = .) %>% 
  summary()
```
