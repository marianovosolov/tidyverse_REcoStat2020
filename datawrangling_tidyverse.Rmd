# Tibbles

>Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: **they do less** (i.e. they don't change variable names or types, and don't do partial matching) and **complain more** (e.g. when a variable does not exist). This forces you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code.

# Let's go over the various packages
---

class: center, middle

# `readr` package

<img src="img/readr.png" width=30%>

---

# read_xxx function

* Neater import than `read.table` and `read.csv`

* Does data check and prints a report of the data imported

* Character columns are not converted to factors

* Most useful are `read_csv`, `read_table`, and `read_delim`

* Competible with pipe workflow

---
# Example

```{r}
mydata<- read_csv("data/sub_PanTHERIA.csv")
```

---

```{r}
mydata
```

class: center, middle

# `janitor` package

<img src="img/janitor.png" width=40%>
---
# `clean_names()` function

* cleans the column names to something more computer friendly

* For example, brings all the column names to lowercase and adds underscores between words
---

# Regular column names
```{r}
mydata
```

---
# Clean column names

```{r}
mydata %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

# Can also be:
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
mydata<- read_csv("data/sub_PanTHERIA.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
mydata

# Run models on subset of the data

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  filter(species =="Droid") %>%

# Some instructions

- Uninstall the previous lesson with

  `uninstall_course("exercise_REcoStat2020")`
  
- Re-install it with `install_course_github("marianovosolov","exercise_REcoStat2020")`

- Start with `swirl()`

- Give it a new name

- Choose the tidyverse exercise within the exercise_REcoStat2020

- Good luck!!
